# **DITA and Structured Content Skills** 

I am currently deepening my expertise in DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) and Oxygen XML Editor, with a focus on structured, reusable, and topic-based documentation. I am actively working on a project that uses DITA to create modular, scalable content, which will soon be available for viewing.

- Project In Progress: My DITA-based documentation project is currently underway and will be shared soon. This project will showcase my ability to produce well-organized, consistent documentation using DITA’s structured framework, highlighting my progress in mastering this essential toolset.
- DITA Proficiency: Through this project, I’m expanding my skills in DITA—creating structured content designed for reuse and multi-channel publishing, essential in professional technical documentation.
- Oxygen XML Editor: Working in Oxygen has given me hands-on experience with XML editing, DITA validation, and topic-based authoring, allowing me to create content that is both accessible and modular.


I’m excited to share this project in the near future, as it reflects my ongoing commitment to building expertise in structured authoring and modern documentation standards. Keep an eye out for the release to see my progress in action!

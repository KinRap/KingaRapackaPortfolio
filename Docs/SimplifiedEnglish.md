# **Simplified English Version: How to get feedback from your SME**

In this project, I rewrote my original article, <a href="https://kinrap.github.io/UNSME/" target="_blank">"Happily Ever After with Unresponsive SMEs"</a>, using Simplified English, a controlled language often used in technical writing to improve clarity and ease of understanding. Simplified English is particularly useful for international audiences or when writing technical documentation that needs to be accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise or language proficiency.

The revised article maintains the core content and strategies for working with unresponsive Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) but simplifies the language to ensure it’s easy to understand for a broader audience. It provides practical advice on managing SME communication, focusing on how technical writers can approach unresponsiveness with diplomacy, while also using clear, straightforward language that is easy to follow.
